Python Genetic Algorithm

This is a library for doing simple genetic algorithms (GAs) in python. 

The GAs described here are not GAs in a "computer science reads the Big Book of Biology" sense. 
Rather, they are GAs as a search optimization technique. Also, the GAs described here are not
the most optimal implementation of GAs as they are also designed to be understandable.

Other libraries may exist for GAs and other problem solving algorithms. They will probably 
be better than this one.

#TODO finish this. Describe files contained here. Describe installer. Describe builder.
